    <h1>Why Hisuian goodra is better than rowlet, here's why. Some of this is my opinion.</h1>
   <h2>In this article, I will explain:</h2> 
    <ol>
      <li>stats</li>
      <li>vs decidueye</li>
      <li>roasting rowlet</li>
    </ol>
<br>
    <h2>Stats</h2>
<h4>this is hisuian goodras stats</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Hp:80</li>
<li>atk:100</li>
<li>def:100</li>
<li>spa:110</li>
<li>spd:150</li>
  <li>spe:60</li>    
    </ul>
<h4>as you can see, the stats add up to 600. The 150 
  special defense can make goodra very hard to kill,
  combined with its utility, such as acid spray and
  the weather moves, and its defensive moves like
  shelter and rest, it can be a tank both physicaly
  and specially, also knowing tons of offensive
  moves.</h4>
    <h2>vs decidueye</h2>
    <h4>Decidueyes stats are </h4>
<ul>
<li>hp:78</li>
<li>atk:107</li>
<li>def:75</li>
<li>spa:100</li>
<li>spd:100</li>
<li>spe:70</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      If you look at the movesets of them both, 
      you will think: decidueye will
      get an easy win because of low sweep right?
      WRONG! Hisuian goodra can tera flying,
      and decidueye has no moves that covers flying types
      meanwhile, goodra has ice, poison, and fire moves.
      If decidueye teras into another type,
      draco meteor can still hit for nuetral.

    <h2>Rowlet bad</h2>
