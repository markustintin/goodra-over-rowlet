    <h2>Stats</h2>
<h4>this is hisuian goodras stats</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Hp:80</li>
<li>atk:100</li>
<li>def:100</li>
<li>spa:110</li>
<li>spd:150</li>
  <li>spe:60</li>    
    </ul>
<h4>as you can see, the stats add up to 600. The 150 special defense can make goodra very hard to kill, combined with its utility, such as acid spray and the weather moves, and its defensive moves like shelter and rest, it can be 
a tank both physicaly and specially, also knowing tons of offensive moves.</h4>
